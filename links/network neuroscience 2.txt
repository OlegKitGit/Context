This result can be compared with results obtained in the framework of the Blue Brain project where is has been observed that pairs of neurons have a more signiﬁcant correlations in their dynamics if they belong to higher dimensional simplicies.

These results reveal that not only network topology but also network geometry plays a crucial role in determining the dynamical properties of a network

However, the connection between network geometry and dynamics has been so far mostly unexplored. Here, we provide a theoretical framework based on simplicial complexes to investigate the effect of network geometry on synchronization dynamics

Our study reveals that a ﬁnite spectral dimension of geometrical networks can be combined with a complex modular network structure to give rise to frustrated synchronization and spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations of the order parameter of the synchronization dynamics.
