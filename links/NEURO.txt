The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from the theoretical point of view

network geometry, synchronization of coupled oscillators, simplicial complex model of manifolds, complex network manifold, <network neuroscience

Here we reveal the rich interplay between network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the
context of a simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold.

The networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable spectral
dimension

network, frustrated synchronization, coupling strength, oscillator, synchronization, spectral dimension, <network neuroscience 

We show that the networks display frustrated synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators, and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral dimension of the network.

Network Theory has provided a large evidence that network topology affects the dynamics and function of complex networks

Recently, growing attention has been devoted to analyze networks not only from the topological viewpoint but, also, from a geometrical perspective

Characterizing the geometry of complex networks is particularly relevant for brain research12, 13, where the embedding in a three-dimensional space is essential to understand the wiring diagram characterizing the connections between brain regions â€“or connectome  and also at a more microscopic neuronal level

Interestingly, recent experimental results have shown that the synchronization properties of neuronal cultures grown on 2D slices differ considerably from those grown on 3D scaffolds

these last ones turn out to be much more likely to maintain synchrony and have two regimes: a highly synchronized regime and a moderately synchronized regime
